        <h1 style="color: brown; text-align: center">Macaron</h1>
        <p><b>A macaron is a French sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond powder or ground almond, and food colouring. The macaron is commonly filled with ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two cookies. The name is derived from the Italian word macarone, maccarone or maccherone, the meringue.</b></p>
        <p>Macarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8<sup>th</sup> century A.D. During the Renaissance, Catherine de' Medici's Italian pastry chefs whom she brought with her in 1533 upon marrying Henry II of France arrived in France. Larousse Gastronomique cites the macaron created in 1791 in a convent near Cormery. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in Nancy during the French Revolution, baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the <em>"Macaron Sisters"</em>. In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavors or fillings.</p>

        <p>It was not until the 1830s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices. The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or ganache filling, was originally called the <em>"Gerbet"</em> or the <em>"Paris macaron"</em>. Pierre Desfontaines of the French pâtisserie Ladurée has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it. French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s.</p>
        <p>Many Italian cookbooks of the 16th century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dated back from the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe.</p>

        <p>There are two methods to making a macaron - the <em>"French"</em> method and the <em>"Italian"</em> method. The difference between the two is the way the meringue is made - either Italian or French meringue can be combined with ground almonds.</p>
        <p>A macaron is made by combining icing sugar and ground almonds until fine. In a separate bowl, egg whites that are beaten until a meringue-like texture. The two elements are then folded together until they are the consistency of <em>"shaving foam"</em>, and then are piped, left to form a skin, and baked. Sometimes, a filling is added.</p>
